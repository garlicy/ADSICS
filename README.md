**Summary:
ADSICS is a surveillance program that enables power distribution companies to detect, analyze, and prevent network anomalies that could threaten their security. It processes alerts and displays them to the companiesâ€™ cybersecurity professionals in an intuitive manner. To complete this project, we have researched about cybersecurity basics, researched and worked with the power grid testbed, performed data augmentation using existing open-source dataset and actual data, and experimented with machine learning algorithms on the testbed environment. We aim to use a machine learning algorithm within our VM to process alerts, ensuring that they enter the alert correlation algorithm with a uniform format and contain all the necessary information (time, location, type) to be analyzed by a user.
